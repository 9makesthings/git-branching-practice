# git-branching-practice

This is a project to practice branching with git.


Some branching commands:

- `git branch` - shows you the branches and which one you are on
- `git branch branch-name` - creates a branch called branch-name
- `git checkout branch-name` - checks out the branch called branch-name
- `git push remote-name branch-name` - pushes code from branch-name to the remote: remote-name (usually `origin`)
